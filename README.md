# Credit_Card_Approval_Prediction
<p> This is a Python based data analytics project, which focus on data cleaning, data manipulation and machine learning. </p>

<p> The goal for this project is to look at the data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains information customers' information such as Income, Education Level, Age and etc, as well as their credit card application status: approved or denied. My job is to look into the data, train and test the data based on the outcome, and eventually build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques. </p>
